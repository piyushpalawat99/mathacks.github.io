# Mathacks

**Mathacks.net** is a platform to share and browse unsuccessful or unfinished attempts in scientific research — especially in mathematics and theoretical fields.

Rather than hiding failures, we celebrate them. Every discarded proof, half-built idea, or failed counterexample might be the spark someone else needs.

## 💡 Why Mathacks?

Science progresses not only by success but by documenting what *doesn’t* work. Yet most negative results and failed conjectures go unpublished.

Mathacks fills that gap.

- Share your failed proof attempts.
- Browse the growing archive of "failures worth sharing."
- Help build a culture of transparency in research.
