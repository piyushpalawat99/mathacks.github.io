## 🙌 How to Contribute

There are lots of ways you can help:

### 🧪 1. Fix or Report Bugs
If something’s broken:
- Search existing [Issues](https://github.com/piyushpalawat99/piyushpalawat99.github.io/issues)
- Open a new one if it's not listed

### 💅 2. Improve the Frontend
We love clean, minimal UI — like Stripe, Notion, or Linear.
You can help with:
- Mobile/responsive layouts
- Dark/light mode toggle
- Navigation and page consistency

### 📝 3. Improve UX for Form Submission
We use:
- Netlify Functions
- Airtable API

You can help:
- Debug form issues
- Improve the thank-you flow
- Add inline form validation

### 🔒 4. Help with Moderation / Submissions
Eventually, we'll add moderation tooling. For now, we're:

- Reviewing before publishing

Suggestions welcome for better workflows!
