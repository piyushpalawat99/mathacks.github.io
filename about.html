    <h1>About Mathacks</h1>
    <p><strong>Mathacks</strong> is a platform for documenting research attempts that didn't work ‚Äî not as a record of failure, but as a resource for others. We believe sharing incomplete, flawed, or failed research helps others avoid dead ends and build on new insights.</p>
    <p>This site was built by Piyush Palawat, inspired by the belief that even our mistakes carry value in the collective effort of knowledge-making.</p>
